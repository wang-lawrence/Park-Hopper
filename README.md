 # Park Hopper

A web application for outdoor enthusiasts to explore our beautiful National Parks.

## Why I Built This

I love the beautiful sceneries and diverse activities that our National Parks have to offer. While I have only been to a handful of parks, I absolutely plan on visiting more when I get the chance! In preparation for that, I thought it would be fun to build an app that showcases the stunning images of the parks and also allow me to learn more about the parks at the same time.
